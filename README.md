<h2>Green Space Area and Childhood Obesity</h2>
In this project, I used machine learning models to classify greenspace area into tree or herbaceous from Sentinel-2 imagery for major cities across the United States (Example from NYC below). Classified greenspace was then used to compare relative greenspace areas and types to childhood obesity rates to determine what outdoor greenspaces are correlated to improved/worse childhood obesity rates. <p align="center">
